== Packaging the Processor as Vivado IP Block

Packaging the entire processor as IP module allows easy integration of the core (or even several cores)
into a block-design-based Vivado project. The NEORV32 repository provides a full-scale TCL script that
automatically packages the processor as IP block.

Besides packaging the HDL modules, the TCL script also generates a simplified customization GUI that enables
configuration of the processor. The rather complex VHDL configuration generics are renamed and provided with tool tips
to make it easier to understand the options.

The following steps show how to package the processor using the provided TCL script and how to import
the generated IP block into the Vivado IP repository.

[start=1]
. Open the Vivado GUI.
. In GUI mode select either "Tools -> Run TCL Script" to directly execute the script or open the TCL
shell ("Window -> Tcl Console") to manually invoke the script.
. Use `cd` in the TCL console to navigate to the project's `neorv32/rtl/system_integration` folder.
. Execute `source source neorv32_vivado_ip.tcl` in the TCL console.
. A second Vivado instance will open automatically packaging the IP module. After this process is completed,
the second Vivado instance will automatically close again.
. A new folder `neorv32_vivado_ip_work` is created in `neorv32/rtl/system_integration` which contains the IP-packaging
Vivado project.
. Inside, the `packaged_ip` folder provides the actual IP module.
. Open your design project in Vivado.
. Click on "Settings" in the "Project Manager" on the left side.
. Under "Project Settings" expand the "IP" section and click on "Repository".
. Click the large plus button and select the previously generated IP folder (`path/to/neorv32/rtl/system_integration/neorv32_vivado_ip_work/packaged_ip`).
. Click "Select" and close the Settings menu with "Apply" and "OK".
. You will find the NEORV32 in the "User Repository" section of the Vivado IP catalog.


.Combinatorial Loops DRC Errors
[WARNING]
If the TRNG is enabled it is recommended to add the following commands to the project's constraints file in order
to prevent DRC errors during bitstream generation:

[source,xdc]
----
set_property SEVERITY {warning} [get_drc_checks LUTLP-1]
set_property IS_ENABLED FALSE [get_drc_checks LUTLP-1]
set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE
----
